CPP
===

- [ ] Unused imports
- [ ] Using namespace std
- [ ] Poor function naming
- [ ] Poor parameter naming
- [ ] Parameters not given as const &
- [ ] Returns a map when it could just be a vector
- [ ] Everything within a try/catch
- [ ] Throws runtime errors without a message
- [ ] Creates raw pointers to the vector
- [ ] <= end will segfault at the end of the loop
- [ ] The push_back will always add from the very beginning of the string
- [ ] The cout will run on every loop, not just split strings.
- [ ] Split strings are added to the keys of a map for no reason.
- [ ] Refs not used in loop
- [ ] Commented out code
- [ ] Catches everything and discards error information
- [ ] Final error cout is unreachable


Python
======

- [ ] Everything in an if, rather than returning early.

- [ ] Magic numbers
- [ ] Repeated calculations
- [ ] val2 immediately overwritten after the if
- [ ] Commented debugging statements
- [ ] Commented code
